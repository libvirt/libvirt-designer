   libvirt Designer
   ================

The libvirt-designer package provides an API to facilitate policy
based configuration of libvirt objects. It uses libosinfo to
drive the configuration of virtual machines with hardware that
is optimized for the current hypervisor platform.

Installation
------------

The libvirt-designer package uses GNU autotools, so the build install
process follows the standard process documented in the INSTALL file.
As a quick start you can do

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
  make
  sudo make install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/libvirt-designer
  make
  make install

The following mandatory dependencies are required in order to
build libvirt-designer

  libvirt-gconfig  >= 0.1.3  (part of libvirt-glib project releases)
  libosinfo        >= 0.0.5
